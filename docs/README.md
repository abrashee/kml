# Documentation

## Purpose
The docs module contains all long-lived documentation explaining
why KML exists and why it is designed the way it is.

Documentation is treated as a first-class artifact in this project.

## Contents
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- High-level architecture diagrams
- Workflow and lifecycle explanations
- API design notes and trade-offs
- System evolution narrative across MVPs

## Audience
- Hiring managers
- Senior engineers
- Technical reviewers

## Notes
If a design decision is non-obvious, it should be documented here.
If a trade-off was made, it should be explained here.
